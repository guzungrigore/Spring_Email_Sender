# Getting Started
#### *This is a small project made by Guzun Grigore about sending an Email.*

---

To test the app, first you'll need to launch the Spring project and then just go to:
http://localhost:8080/

---
In this project you can insert the email of the recipient, the subject, the body and also an attachment. 

But in order to send a file, you'll need to attach it's absolut path and as of right now it will only work with .txt type of files.

If everything was provided, then an email will be sent from my personal email to whichever email was specified in that form.
